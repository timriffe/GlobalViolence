These diagnostic flipbooks are produced in DataPrep_Graduate.R
We notice that since pclm has no demographic priors, the 
closeout mortality (in high ages, especially the extapolation
beyond age 95) can be erratic and unrealistic. Due to visual examination
of these flibooks we opt to strongly smooth old-age mortality using
a flexible model: gamma gompertz falls somewhere between gompertz and 
kannisto, depending, so it suits us.
