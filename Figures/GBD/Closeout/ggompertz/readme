These diagnostic flipbooks produced by DataPrep_Closeout.R
These are identical to those in Figures/GBD/Closeout/pclm
below age 65, and are different above age 65.

Presently the MortalityLaws gamma gompertz extrapolation (65-110) 
is simply grafted onto graduated mortality in ages 0-64, 
which in many instances induces a slight ridge at age 65
since they don't join perfectly. This is similar to the age
80 ridge in HMD data. Overall, the patterns in ages 65-95 are
smoother and more believable than those given straight from pclm
while ages 95-110 now will have less leverage on results, 
as desired. Age 65 is still higher than our study area, so we accept
this slight ridge as an aesthetic artifact with trivial 
leverage on results.
